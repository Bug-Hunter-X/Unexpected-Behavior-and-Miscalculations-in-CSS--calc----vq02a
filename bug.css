The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with percentages and viewport units in nested contexts. Consider this example: `.parent { width: 50vw; } .child { width: calc(50% - 10px); }`. In this case, the `50%` in `calc()` will be relative to the parent's width (which itself is relative to the viewport), leading to unexpected results if the parent's width is not exactly half of the viewport. This is because the percentage is calculated based on the parent's width, not the viewport directly.  Another potential issue is incorrect operator precedence. Be very careful when using multiple operators within a single `calc()` expression, as the order of operations might not always behave as expected, leading to incorrect calculations. For instance, make sure you understand the order of operations in expressions like `calc(100px + 50% * 2)`. Always use parentheses for clarity.
