To address the issue of unexpected results with nested percentages and viewport units, consider using absolute units or explicitly defining the context for percentages. For instance, replace percentage calculations with fixed pixel values or use Javascript to dynamically calculate widths based on viewport size. To mitigate incorrect operator precedence, always use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations in complex `calc()` expressions. This improves readability and ensures the intended calculation. Consider rewriting `calc(100px + 50% * 2)` as `calc(100px + (50% * 2))` for clarity.  For more complex calculations, consider pre-calculating values using Javascript and setting the CSS property directly. This can significantly improve readability and avoid unexpected `calc()` behavior.
